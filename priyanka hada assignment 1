What is Python, and why is it popular?\n"," Ans- Python is a versatile high level programming language known for its\n"," beginner\n"," friendly English like syntax that emphasises code readability and conciseness\n"," It is popular because its easy to use and has vast ecosystem of pre written\n","code, tools and framework which save users time and efforts by allowing them\n"," to reuse existing code.\n","\n","\n"," 2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n"," Ans-A python interpreter is a program that converts Python code into\n","machine readable code and run them and enabling you to execute python\n","script and view results instantly. It acts as a bridge between the high-level\n","python code you write and the low-level instructions that the computer can\n","directly utilize.\n","\n"," 3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n"," Ans- pre-defined keywords are reserved words that hold the special meaning\n","within the language. These keywords cannot be used as identifiers for\n","variables, functions, classes or any other user defined entities.\n","\n"," 4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n"," Ans- No\n","\n"," 5. What is mutability in Python?\n"," Ans- An object is considered as mutable if its state or value can be modified\n","after it is created.\n","\n"," 6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n"," Ans- list can be modified after they created but tuples cannot be modified\n","after they were created because this ensures data integrity as once a tuple is\n","defined its element cannot be accidently or intensely changed.\n","\n","\n"," 7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n"," Ans- The == operator is used to compare the equality of objects. The is\n","operator is used to check if different variables are pointing to the same object\n","in the memory.\n","\n","\n"," 8. What are logical operators in Python?\n"," Ans-Logical operators in Python are used to combine conditional statements,\n","allowing you to evaluate multiple conditions and control the flow of your\n","program. These operators return a Boolean value (True or False) based on the\n","logic applied.\n","\n"," 9. What is type casting in Python?\n"," Ans- Type Casting in Python refers to the process of converting one data type\n"," into another. This can be done either implicitly (automatically by Python)\n","or explicitly (manually by the programmer). It is often used to ensure\n","compatibility between different data types during operations.\n","\n"," 10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n"," Ans - Implicit Type Casting - This is an automatic type conversion performed by\n","Python. It happens when Python converts a smaller or less precise data type into\n","a larger or more precise data type to avoid data loss.\n"," For ex\n","a= 5\n"," b= 3.5\n"," c= a+b\n"," print(c)\n"," print(type(c))\n"," output:\n"," 8.5\n"," Float\n"," Explicit Type Casting - This is a manual type conversion where the programmer\n","explicitly specifies the desired data type using type conversion functions like int\n","(), float (), str (), etc.\n"," For ex\n","a= \"10\"\n"," b= 3\n"," c=int(a)+b\n","print(c)\n"," Python basic question\n"," print(type(c))\n"," output:\n"," 13\n"," Int\n","\n","\n"," 11.   What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n"," Ans - Conditional statements in Python are used to control the flow of a program\n"," by executing specific blocks of code based on whether certain conditions are true\n"," or false. They allow programs to make decisions and behave differently in various\n","situations.\n","\n"," 12. How does the Elif statement work?\n"," Ans-The Elif statement in Python allows you to check multiple conditions in a\n","sequence, executing the block of code associated with the first true condition.\n"," For ex\n","temperature =30\n"," if temperature >30:\n"," print(\"hot\")\n"," elif\n"," temperature <= 30:\n"," print(\"cold\")\n"," output- cold\n","\n"," 13.    What is the difference between for and while loops.\n"," Ans - For Loop: Used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or\n","range) or any iterable object. It is ideal when the number of iterations is\n","known beforehand.\n"," For ex\n","i=5\n"," for i in range(5):\n","   print(i)\n"," Python basic question\n"," output – 0\n"," 1\n"," 2\n"," 3\n"," 4\n"," While Loop: Used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified\n","condition is True. It is better suited for scenarios where the number of\n","iterations is not predetermined.\n"," For ex -  count = 0\n"," while count < 5:\n","   print(count)\n"," count += 1\n"," output – 1\n"," 2\n"," 3\n"," 4\n"],"metadata":{"id":"nMb198z4e-j-"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["1.
