 Python basic question


 1. What is Python, and why is it popular?
 Ans- Python is a versatile high level programming language known for its
 beginner
 friendly English like syntax that emphasises code readability and conciseness
 It is popular because its easy to use and has vast ecosystem of pre written
code, tools and framework which save users time and efforts by allowing them
 to reuse existing code.


 2. What is an interpreter in Python?
 Ans-A python interpreter is a program that converts Python code into
machine readable code and run them and enabling you to execute python
script and view results instantly. It acts as a bridge between the high-level
python code you write and the low-level instructions that the computer can
directly utilize.

 3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?
 Ans- pre-defined keywords are reserved words that hold the special meaning
within the language. These keywords cannot be used as identifiers for
variables, functions, classes or any other user defined entities.

 4. Can keywords be used as variable names?
 Ans- No

 5. What is mutability in Python?
 Ans- An object is considered as mutable if its state or value can be modified
after it is created.

 6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?
 Ans- list can be modified after they created but tuples cannot be modified
after they were created because this ensures data integrity as once a tuple is
defined its element cannot be accidently or intensely changed.


 7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?
 Ans- The == operator is used to compare the equality of objects. The is
operator is used to check if different variables are pointing to the same object
in the memory.


 8. What are logical operators in Python?
 Ans-Logical operators in Python are used to combine conditional statements,
allowing you to evaluate multiple conditions and control the flow of your
program. These operators return a Boolean value (True or False) based on the
logic applied.

 9. What is type casting in Python?
 Ans- Type Casting in Python refers to the process of converting one data type
 into another. This can be done either implicitly (automatically by Python)
or explicitly (manually by the programmer). It is often used to ensure
compatibility between different data types during operations.

 10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?
 Ans - Implicit Type Casting - This is an automatic type conversion performed by
Python. It happens when Python converts a smaller or less precise data type into
a larger or more precise data type to avoid data loss.
 For ex
a= 5
 b= 3.5
 c= a+b
 print(c)
 print(type(c))
 output:
 8.5
 Float
 Explicit Type Casting - This is a manual type conversion where the programmer
explicitly specifies the desired data type using type conversion functions like int
(), float (), str (), etc.
 For ex
a= "10"
 b= 3
 c=int(a)+b
print(c)
 Python basic question
 print(type(c))
 output:
 13
 Int


 11.   What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?
 Ans - Conditional statements in Python are used to control the flow of a program
 by executing specific blocks of code based on whether certain conditions are true
 or false. They allow programs to make decisions and behave differently in various
situations.

 12. How does the Elif statement work?
 Ans-The Elif statement in Python allows you to check multiple conditions in a
sequence, executing the block of code associated with the first true condition.
 For ex
temperature =30
 if temperature >30:
 print("hot")
 elif
 temperature <= 30:
 print("cold")
 output- cold

 13.    What is the difference between for and while loops.
 Ans - For Loop: Used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or
range) or any iterable object. It is ideal when the number of iterations is
known beforehand.
 For ex
i=5
 for i in range(5):
   print(i)
 Python basic question
 output – 0
 1
 2
 3
 4
 While Loop: Used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified
condition is True. It is better suited for scenarios where the number of
iterations is not predetermined.
 For ex -  count = 0
 while count < 5:
   print(count)
 count += 1
 output – 1

1. Write a Python program to print "Hello, World”.
 Ans-   print (“Hello World!”)
     Output- Hello World!
 2. Write a Python program that displays your name and age.
 Ans- Name="Priyanka"
            Age=28
 Python basic question
            print (Name,Age)
           Output – Priyanka,28
 3. Write code to print all the pre-defined keywords in Python using the keyword
library.
 Ans - help(“keywords”)
         Output - Here is a list of the Python keywords.  Enter any keyword to get
more
help.
 False               class               from                or
 None                continue            global              pass
 True                def                 if                  raise
 and                 del                 import              return
 as
elif
                in                  try
 assert              else                is                  while
 async               except              lambda              with
 await               finally             nonlocal            yield
 break               for                 not
 4. Write a program that checks if a given word is a Python keyword.
 Ans
5. Create a list and tuple in Python, and demonstrate how attempting to change
 an element works differently for each.
 Ans- Creating a list
 My_list = [1,2,3,4]
 My_list[1] = 20

Python basic question
 Output = [1,20,3,4]
 Creating a tuple
 my_tuple = (1,2,3,4)
 my_tuple(1) == 20
                print(my_tuple)
                output -
TypeError: 'tuple' object is not callable.

 substraction = num1 - num2
 print(substraction)
 multiplication = num1 * num2
 print(multiplication)
 division = num1 / num2
 print(division)
